# No'Div'ember

This challenge was posted by [jhey](https://twitter.com/jh3yy) and because my CSS skills are limited I decided to jump in and start messing around with CSS art.

## Challenge

For the 30 days of November, make CSS art!

- You don't have to do every day! Can't stress this enough.
- Use only the body, body:after, and body:before elements
- No images (Tracing encouraged though with credit)
- Animation === bonus points!
- Share the results with me on Twitter/CodePen (#nodivember)
